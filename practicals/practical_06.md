# MMB8052 Practical 06 - Case Study I: Sequence Alignment

# Introduction

The alignment of biological sequences is a core technique in bioinformatics. Without effective algorithms for sequence alignment we wouldn't have methods for predicting protein structure, for working with genome-scale sequencing data or for studying evolution at the molecular level. The foundational algorithms for aligning sequences were developed in the 70s and 80s, and are still used today.

This practical will look at some applications of sequence alignment - including the optimal alignment of two sequences, the use of alignment techniques to search large databases and the simultaneous alignment of multiple sequences. We will use command line tools to explore these applications.

# Principles of Sequence Alignment

Biological sequence alignment relies on an understanding of the molecular mechanisms of evolution, and makes the base assumption that the sequences in an alignment share a common ancestor. The alignment process therefore, is seeking to mirror the point mutations, insertions and deletions which over evolutionary time have given rise to the divergence bewteen the sequences.
