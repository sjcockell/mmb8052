# MMB8052 Practical 03 - Project Management and Version Control

# Introduction

The life of a laboratory scientist is improved by a well organised lab, and lab book. Similarly, the computational scientist's lot is made better by well-organised and well-documented electronic files. It doesn't really matter how big or small the bioinformatics project you're working on is, you will make things easier on yourself by having a project directory laid out in a consistent and easy to understand fashion.

Processing hundreds of sequence files becomes trivial with scripting if these files are consistently named and are organised in a logical directory structure. If the structure and naming conventions are shared between projects, then the scripts written for one project become reusable for the next.

In this practical, we will look at some of the best practices surrounding the organisation and documentation of bioinformatics projects. In addition we will take a look at a modern _version control_ system (VCS), called `git`. Version control is important for managing the process of writing computer code - a VCS is a piece of software which records the changes made to a file or set of files over time, and allows the user to share those changes with others, to work on parallel versions of the same code base, and to rollback changes made to the project at any time.

A good document management process, coupled with robust version control are critical in enabling reproducible computational science.
